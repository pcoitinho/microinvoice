# Micro Invoice

Minimal Invoicing system done the WordPress way

## What is Micro?

Thnk big. Start Micro.

You know that plugin that does one thing you want, but comes packed with padding that only serves to slow down your site? We hate that.

Micro is a design philosophy that ties in with the WordPress way of thinking.

Micro aims to create an environment of plugins with atomized funcionality that build on each other. Each Micro plugin focuses on doing one thing, and does it well; further funcionality is added as add-ones, so you don't have to work with a bloated WordPress installation, full of features you don't use.
Say to to plugins that ovewrite each other's functionalities.

### Micro's mission:

* Be small and nimble. Do only one thing.
* Speak WordPress. Use its language, be trasparent.
* Hook up. Expose well documented hooks and filters.
* Plug and play. Avoid configuration when possible.
* Grow step by step. Include add-ons for more funcitonality.
